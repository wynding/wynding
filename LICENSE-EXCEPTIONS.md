# License Exceptions

Wynding — **all of it: code, art, audio, content data, and documentation** — is
licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or later**
(AGPL-3.0-or-later); see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text. For assets, the AGPL
"source" is the editable master (see
[ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-asset-and-content-licensing.md)). The exception below
therefore covers the whole work — code and assets alike.

In addition, the copyright holders grant the following additional permission
under section 7 of that license. This permission is granted to **everyone** — not
only the original authors — so that anyone may build and distribute Wynding
through app stores and similar platforms while the project remains fully open
source under the AGPL.

## Wynding App Store Exception, version 1.0

**Additional permission under section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3 (or, at your option, any later version).**

As an additional permission under section 7 of the AGPL, you are permitted to
convey this Program, or a covered work based on it, through an application store
or other software distribution platform or channel — including, without
limitation, the Apple App Store, Google Play, Microsoft Store, Steam, and console
storefronts — and to accept and comply with that platform's terms of service and
technical measures (including, without limitation, code signing, mandatory
account acceptance, device or installation limits, and digital rights management),
**even where those terms or measures would otherwise be incompatible with the
AGPL**, provided that:

1. the complete Corresponding Source (as defined by the AGPL) for the version you
   convey is **also** made available to recipients under the AGPL — with or
   without this additional permission — through at least one channel that does
   **not** impose those restrictive terms or measures; and

2. you otherwise comply with the AGPL in all respects, including providing the
   license text and preserving license and copyright notices.

### Later versions of this exception

The Wynding project may publish revised and/or new versions of this exception.
Such versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, and will **only
grant additional permissions — never impose new restrictions**. You may follow the
terms of this version 1.0 or of any later version published by the project, at
your option.

### Scope and removal

This additional permission applies only to material whose copyright holders have
granted it. It does **not** extend to any third-party components that are
distributed with Wynding under their own licenses; those components remain
governed solely by their respective licenses.

As provided by section 7 of the AGPL, a recipient may remove this additional
permission from any copy of the covered work, or from any part of it, that they
convey. Doing so affects only that recipient's copies; it does not remove the
permission from the project's canonical distribution, and it does not act
retroactively on copies already conveyed.

_Note: `package.json` files declare `"license": "AGPL-3.0-or-later"`. That
identifier deliberately understates the permissions granted here (npm's SPDX field
does not cleanly express a custom exception), which is the safe direction — it never
claims more permission than is actually granted. This file is the authoritative
statement of the exception._
